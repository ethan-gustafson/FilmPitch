# Welcome to FilmPitch!

FilmPitch is a web application that lets users create their own "pitches": their dream film project which could be a short film,
silent, documentary, series, etc. Each "pitch" is allowed to be funded by any user until the funding goal is reached. When a users
pitch is fully funded, they can post their own link to their pitch so that their finished product is viewable.
